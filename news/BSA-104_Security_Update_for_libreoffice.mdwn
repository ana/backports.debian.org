	Rene Engelhard uploaded new packages for libreoffice which fixed the
	following security problem:

	CVE-2015-1774:
	   It was discovered that missing input sanitising in Libreoffice's filter
	   for HWP documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code if a
	   malformed document is opened.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problem has been fixed in
	version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0deb7u4~bpo60+1.

	For the wheezy-backports distribution the problem has been fixed in
	version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u1~bpo70+1.
