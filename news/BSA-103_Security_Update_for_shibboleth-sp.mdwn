	Matthew Vernon uploaded new packages for shibboleth-sp which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2015-2684
	  A denial of service vulnerability was found in the Shibboleth (a
	  federated identity framework) Service Provider. When processing
	  certain malformed SAML messages generated by an authenticated
	  attacker, the daemon could crash.

	For the wheezy-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.5.3+dfsg-2~bpo70+1.
