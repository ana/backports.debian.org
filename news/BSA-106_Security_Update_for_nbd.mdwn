	Wouter Verhelst uploaded new packages for nbd which fixed the following
	security problems:

	CVE-2015-0847
	  Tuomas R채s채nen discovered that nbd-server unsafe signal handling in
	  nbd-server, the server for the Network Block Device protocol, could
	  allow remote attackers to cause a deadlock in the server process and
	  thus a denial of service.

	CVE-2013-7441
	  Tuomas R채s채nen discovered that the modern-style negotiation was
	  carried out in the main process before forking the actual client
	  handler. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of
	  service (crash) by querying a non-existent export.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution,the problems have been fixed in
	version 1:3.2-4~deb7u5~bpo60+1.

	The wheezy-backports and jessie-backports suites do not contain nbd
	packages, and therefore are not vulnerable (but see DSA-3271-1).
