	Thomas Goirand uploaded new packages for horizon which fixed the
	following security problem:

	CVE-2015-3988:
	  Sunil Yadav from IBM Security Services reported a persistent XSS in
	  Horizon. An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by
	  setting a malicious metadata to a Glance image, a Nova flavor or a
	  Host Aggregate and tricking an administrator to load the update
	  metadata page. Once executed in a legitimate context this attack may
	  result in a privilege escalation.

	For the jessie-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	2015.1.0-2~bpo8+1.
