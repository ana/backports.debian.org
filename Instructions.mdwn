## About backports ##

Backports are recompiled packages from testing (mostly) and unstable (in a few
cases only, e.g. security updates) in a stable environment so that they will
run without new libraries (whenever it is possible) on a Debian stable
distribution

Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports
are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other
components in Debian stable. Use with care!

It is therefore recommended to select single backported packages that fit
your needs, and not use all available backports.


##Add backports to your sources.list 

1.  For squeeze add this line 
    <pre>deb http://http.debian.net/debian-backports squeeze-backports(-sloppy) main</pre>
    to your **sources.list** (or add a new file with the ".list" extension to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/).
    You can also find a list of other mirrors at
    <http://backports.debian.org/Mirrors/>

    For wheezy add this line
    <pre>deb http://http.debian.net/debian wheezy-backports main</pre> to your **sources.list** 
    (or add a new file with the ".list" extension to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
    You can also find a list of other mirrors at
    <https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>

    For jessie add this line
    <pre>deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main</pre> to your **sources.list** 
    (or add a new file with the ".list" extension to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
    You can also find a list of other mirrors at
    <https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>

2. Run **apt-get update**

##Install a package from backports

All backports are deactivated by default (i.e. the packages are pinned to 100 by using ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes in the Release files. If you want to install something from backports run:

    apt-get -t jessie-backports install "package"

of course you can use aptitude as well:

    aptitude -t jessie-backports install "package"

##sloppy distributions

To guarantee a clean upgrade path from a previously stable distribution to the
next stable it is not allowed to upload packages from the current testing to
that backport distribution. To allow some newer packages for those systems we
create so called sloppy distributions. For oldstable (wheezy) packages from
the current testing (stretch) are allowed to be uploaded to
wheezy-backports-sloppy. For LTS (squeeze) we only allow packages from the
current stable (jessie) to squeeze-backports-sloppy.

You can use it exactly as the current backports distribution, just add another line to your **sources.list** and install 
new packages via
	apt-get -t squeeze-backports-sloppy install <packages>
    or
    apt-get -t wheezy-backports sloppy install <packages>
